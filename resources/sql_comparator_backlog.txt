Enchancements:

1. Comparing step should be moved from UI. Instead of manually possibility of setting comparing step I should implement
feature which automatically changes comparing step in case of slow or fast connection. Logic: if comparing speed lower
than some hardcoded value, I should decrease comparing step.
? 2. Status bar should updates in background, application should ping servers by some timeout
3. Bug. datetime writed to result file in format datetime(2018-08-09) it's incorrect.
4. Fix sendmail. # probably with configuring on gmail side.
5. Add special search lineedits to modal windows like "skip_tables".
6. Only first error flag not works.
7. Fix hanging of comparator on huge tables (like creative_page_position for irving).
8. Make default setting for mysql-port field.
